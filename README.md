# Go Fundamentals

## ðŸ“˜ Description
The Go-Fundamentals repository provides a comprehensive guide to learning and mastering the Go programming language. This repository is ideal for developers who want to understand Go through practical examples and structured projects.

Key topics covered:

- Go Basics: Learn how to declare variables, functions, and manage packages.
- Control Structures: Understand loops, conditionals, and error handling.
- Concurrency: Work with goroutines and channels for parallel execution.
- Data Structures: Implement slices, maps, structs, and interfaces.
- File Handling: Read and write files using Goâ€™s built-in libraries.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
The project is organized in a way that allows for easy navigation, each section focusing on specific aspects of Go. Here is a breakdown of the file and folder structure:

### **Main Files**
### **Fundamentals/** 
This folder contains essential examples and code snippets that demonstrate Go basics:

- type_conversion.go: Demonstrates type conversion and type casting, essential for changing one data type into another (e.g., converting int to float64).
- string_operations.go: Showcases various string operations such as concatenation, length, and substring operations.
- wrappers.go: Introduces Goâ€™s handling of primitive types and their associated methods.
- primitive_types.go: An overview of primitive data types in Go (e.g., int, float64, bool) and their default values, size, and use cases.

### Operators/

This folder highlights examples of Go operators and logical constructs:

- relational_operators.go: Examples of relational and comparison operators (<, >, ==, !=, <=, >=) and their usage.
- ternary_alternative.go: A workaround for Goâ€™s lack of a ternary operator using if-else constructs.
- Additional examples focusing on other logical (&&, ||, !) and arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %).

### Exercises/

Contains practical exercises to solidify the understanding of Go fundamentals. These exercises are meant to challenge developers and provide hands-on experience with different topics. Exercise Topics:

- Data Types: Create programs that handle different data types.
- Operators: Implement challenges requiring specific operators.
- String Manipulation: Write code that handles text processing tasks.
- Loops & Conditional Statements: Exercises on using for, if-else, and switch statements.
- Type Conversion: Write code that converts between various data types using casting and conversion methods.
